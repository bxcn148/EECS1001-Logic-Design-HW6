(20%) Draw the logic diagram of a four-bit register with four D flip-flops and four 4×1 multiplexers with mode selection S1 and S0. The register operates according to the following function table.

S1

S0

(20%) Ring counter vs Johnson counter: for a 6-bit ring counter

Design a 6-bit ring counter using shift registers.

List the 6 states produced with three flip-flops and the Boolean terms of each of the 6 AND gate outputs.

(20%) Use D flip-flops and gates to design a binary counter with each of the following repeated binary sequences:

2,3,6 

1,3,5,7 

(20%) Use the serial adder (A+B) in the textbook as an example to design a serial subtractor (A-B).

(20%) Frequency divider:

Design a frequency divider to provide the output signal with frequency as 1/3 of the that of the original signal.

Design a frequency divider to provide the output signal with frequency as 1/6 of the that of the original signal.
